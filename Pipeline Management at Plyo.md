# Pipeline Management at Plyo
###### What the hell is it, and how the hell should we do it


## The Challenge
> We're doing many things at once and we have too little control of what's next

Symptoms:
- Ever-growing backlog
- Current sprint is moving target
- Next/future sprint(s) in constant evolvement
- Future epic delivery timeframe keeps getting pushed

> In other words, we're often behind

### Why is that?
These factors/incidents contribute to this situation:
- Client processes dictate our priorities (to a too large degree)
- Delivery specifications are too vague, or misunderstanding has occured
- Estimates are way off - things take much longer than we expect
- "Polishing phase bleed" - we're responding to client feedback way beyond handoff/delivery date

### Current sales funnel

### How this affects dev cycle
- Constant context switching
- Too little epic preparation time
- Just-in-time design process
	- Little room for feedback
- Patch-work approach to new features

### Ideal sales funnel

## The Solution


### Internal process changes

#### Practice & process
- Being honest with clients
- Less prone to pressure from clients
	- aka. Being Honest/Professional/Confident
- Including "feedback and improvement" cycle in delivery plan
- More accurate estimates
	- "Know your self" - determine accurate team velocity
- Higher capacity - more devs!
- Lower overhead - less bugs!

### Framework & implementation
- Linear pipeline ("just in time pull flow")
- Fixed sprints (start and end-dates)
- Set story points in Jira (epic "weight")
	- To accurately determine velocity, over time
- Time tracking in Jira
- Retrospectives, to continuosly monitor dev cycle health


### Project pipeline changes

#### Current sales pipeline at Plyo
1. Sales pitch (intro sales meeting)
2. Further client input
3. Proposal writing
4. Waiting...
5. Signing?

#### Current delivery lifecycle at Plyo
1. Feature design (UI, UX) based on client needs
2. Estimatations
3. Proposal writing
4. Acceptance?
5. Dev!

#### Ideal sales pipeline at Plyo

## Summary

### Sales team
- Refinements to sales/proposal process
- More time for specifications and design
- Pilot project if necessary
- Full pricing at a later stage
- Under-promise rather than under-deliver

### Management
- Fixed sprints
- More strict
	- pipeline management
	- estimate evaluation
	- QA & feedback phase
- Take time for retrospects

### Dev team
- Keep tracking time accurately
- Continuous evaluation of Team Velocity
- Estimation & analyzation is part of the dev cycle
